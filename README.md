# ML-Based IC Verification

**ML-Based IC Verification** is an advanced software toolkit designed for optimizing **hardware verification** using **machine learning** techniques. It improves **coverage-based verification, rare event detection, and bug identification**, making the design verification process more efficient and intelligent.

This toolkit extends traditional **formal verification and simulation** by integrating **supervised learning and reinforcement learning** to:
- **Enhance rare event detection** by training models on underrepresented failure cases.
- **Improve coverage metrics** (functional, toggle, and FSM coverage).
- **Target bugs more effectively** through adaptive learning in the verification process.

The current version includes intelligent simulation guided by formal models, enabling **automated bug detection**, **adaptive test generation**, and **coverage optimization**. 

### **Key Features**
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses **supervised learning** and **reinforcement learning** to optimize test coverage.
- **Rare Event Detection**: Enhances the ability to find low-probability yet critical bugs.
- **Automated Bug Targeting**: Identifies and prioritizes areas of the design most prone to errors.
- **Flexible Framework**: Works with various hardware verification environments.
